## Welcome to Coding++

This is the place where I posted my notes and thoughts about computer engineering. The contents vary a lot: my reading notes, logs on how I set up my working environment as well as my project descriptios.

You can find all my posted projects on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/he44).

The [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/he44/he44.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/he44/he44.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
